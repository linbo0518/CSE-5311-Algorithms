## Exercise 8.2-3 on Page 196

The algorithm is still correct, but it is not stable, because each sublist of the same number will be inverted, 
the sublist will be from right to left when j from 1 to A.length
so the algorithm is not stable.

## Exercise 8.3-4 on Page 200

First, convert all numbers to 3 digits then use radix sort. We need to perform three iterations to sort,  each iteration's time complexity is $\Theta(n)$.

So we can sort in $\Theta(n)$ time complexity.

## Exercise 9.1-1 on Page 215

Compare every two elements of the array, so we first find the smallest element by $n - 1$ comparisons.
And then compare all the numbers which smallest element was compared, it takes $\lg{n} - 1$ comparisons.

So $n - 1 + \lg{n} - 1 = n + \ulcorner\lg{n}\urcorner -2$

## Exercise 9.3-1 on Page 223

It still work if they are divided into groups of 7.

There are $4(\frac{1}{2}\ulcorner\frac{n}{7}-2\urcorner)$ element greater than x,
so $T(n) = T(\frac{5n}{7} + 8) +T(\frac{n}{7}) + \Theta(n)$, and $T(n) \le cn$

It not work if they are divided into groups of 3.

There are $4(\frac{1}{2}\ulcorner\frac{n}{3}-2\urcorner)$ element greater than x,
so $T(n) = T(\frac{2n}{3} + 4) +T(\frac{n}{3}) + \Theta(n)$, and $T(n) = \Theta(n\lg{n})$

## Exercise 9.3-8 on Page 223

```pseudocode
MEDIAN(X, Y, n)
    if n == 1
        return min(X[1], Y[1])
    if X[n // 2] < Y[n // 2]
        return MEDIAN(X[(n // 2 + 1):n], Y[1:(n // 2)], n // 2)
    return MEDIAN(X[1:(n // 2)], Y[(n // 2 + 1):n], n // 2)
```
